included ebuild renamed -9999-r1 for the sake of distinguishing versions. 
Yes you can select versions from the history but I don't even know how to use that yet.
The changes in this;

I have corrected install details;
	- an __init__.py to webcamoid/
	- correct install of content of webcamoid/ usr/share/apps/plasma/plasmoids/
	- toggle back to eclass python distutils enforces processes in pkg_posinst && pkg_postrm
	- take out the distutils vars

It should now give the correct install pattern I was intending.
Whether this is the right one is dtill to be determined.
Seeing no-one knows about plasmoids and thei setup, I am figuring it as I go.

-r2 is like a combo of the first version which uses distutils and adds the install of the plasmoid itself 
into usr/share/apps/plasma/plasmoids.

-r3 refined a little, removed some un-needed lines.  Added installing the v4l2 python folder into its place in 
the source into /usr/share/apps/plasma/plasmoids/webcamoid

Just don't consider this as a suggested final form, it's experimental because I can find no present python 
written plasmoids and no-one seems to know how to use plasmapkg.  In its current form it doubles the install 
of the v4l2 to 2 sites to cover all possibilites.  Once I figure what is not required those lines will go and 
it will shrink.
